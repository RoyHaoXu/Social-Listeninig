A flight proven Falcon 9 and Dragon fly four astronauts to the space station,59.0,Ever look into vertical farming Water recycling technology Carbon capture tech Advancements in solar energy capture Or is it all just rockets This is all well and good assisting ISS but in your efforts to get to Mars there seems to be a lack of any sustainability once there What if you invest in the aforementioned technologies and try them out in areas with people that have desperately needed assistance Maybe Flint would LOVE to try the new “Space X water filtration system ” Or farmland destroyed by climate change can be testing grounds for indoor vertical farming I really want to love your endeavors but you’re spending billions on rockets while citizens starve And well it’s your money but what if your spending could benefit your company’s mission AND the people of this planet That would be true ingenuity It seems you apparently think “transporting people” is the first step to colonization but when our infrastructure is inexplicably tied to our planets natural resources then we’re not ready to colonize another plant lol ¯ ツ ¯ When we can sustainably harvest resources anywhere we go then we’ll be able to start checkin’ out new planets but I’m sure quite a few people would REALLY love to try it on this planet first,3 stars,3,2021-04-23,spacex,facebook
